# PD-SPHinXsys

Coupled NOSB-PD and low-dissipation Riemann SPH for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and impact fracture problems.
An Ice Plastic Damage (IPD) model is developed to effectively capture the quasi-brittle behavior of oridinary ice.
The typical circumferential and radial cracks are vividly simulated.

To learn about the usage of this code, please refer to the [PDREADME](PDREADME.md).
